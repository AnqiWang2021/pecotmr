\title{Process Credible Set Information and Determine Updating Strategy}
\usage{
auto_decision(df, high_corr_cols)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame. Contains information about Credible Sets for a specific study and block.}

\item{high_corr_cols}{Character vector. Names of columns in df that represent high correlations.}
}
\value{
A modified data frame with additional columns attached to the diagnostic table:
  \item{top_cs}{Logical. TRUE for the CS with the highest absolute Z-score.}
  \item{tagged_cs}{Logical. TRUE for CS that are considered "tagged" based on p-value and correlation criteria.}
  \item{method}{Character. The determined updating strategy ("BVSR", "SER", or "BCR").}
}
\description{
This function categorizes Credible Sets (CS) within a study block into different 
updating strategies based on their statistical properties and correlations.
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:
1. Identifies the top CS based on the highest absolute Z-score.
2. Identifies tagged CS based on high p-value and high correlations.
3. Counts total, tagged, and remaining CS.
4. Determines the appropriate updating method based on these counts.

The updating methods are:
- BVSR (Bayesian Variable Selection Regression): Used when there's only one CS or all CS are accounted for.
- SER (Single Effect Regression): Used when there are tagged CS but no remaining untagged CS.
- BCR (Bayesian Conditional Regression): Used when there are remaining untagged CS.
}
\note{
This function is part of a developing methodology for automatically handling 
finemapping results. The thresholds and criteria used (e.g., p-value > 1e-4 for tagging) 
are subject to refinement and may change in future versions.
