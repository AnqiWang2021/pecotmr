\title{Parse Credible Set Correlations from extract_cs_info() Output}
\usage{
parse_cs_corr(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame or data.table. The output from `extract_cs_info()` function,
containing a `cs_corr` column with correlation information.}
}
\value{
A data.table with the original columns from the input, plus:
  \item{cs_corr_1, cs_corr_2, ...}{Individual correlation values, with column names
        based on their position in the original string}
  \item{cs_corr_max}{Maximum absolute correlation value (excluding 1)}
  \item{cs_corr_min}{Minimum absolute correlation value}
}
\description{
This function takes the output from `extract_cs_info()` and expands the `cs_corr` column
into multiple columns, preserving the original order of correlations. It also
calculates maximum and minimum correlation values for each Credible Set.
}
\details{
The function splits the `cs_corr` column, which typically contains correlation
values separated by '|', into individual columns. It preserves the order of
these correlations, allowing for easy interpretation in a matrix-like format.
}
\note{
- This function converts the input to a data.table if it isn't already one.
- It handles cases where correlation values might be missing or not in the expected format.
- The function assumes that correlation values of 1 represent self-correlations and excludes
  these when calculating max and min correlations.
