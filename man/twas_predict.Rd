\title{Predict outcomes using TWAS weights}
\usage{
twas_predict(X, weights_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix or data frame of predictors where each row is an observation and each
column is a variable.}

\item{weights_list}{A list of numeric vectors representing the weights for each predictor.
The names of the list elements should follow the pattern \code{[outcome]_weights}, where
\code{[outcome]} is the name of the outcome variable that the weights are associated with.}
}
\value{
A named list of numeric vectors, where each vector is the predicted outcome for the
corresponding set of weights in \code{weights_list}. The names of the list elements are
derived from the names in \code{weights_list} by replacing "_weights" with "_predicted".
}
\description{
This function takes a matrix of predictors (\code{X}) and a list of TWAS (transcriptome-wide
association studies) weights (\code{weights_list}), and calculates the predicted outcomes by
multiplying \code{X} by each set of weights in \code{weights_list}. The names of the elements
in the output list are derived from the names in \code{weights_list}, with "_weights" replaced
by "_predicted".
}
\examples{
# Assuming `X` is your matrix of predictors and `weights_list` is your list of weights:
predicted_outcomes <- twas_predict(X, weights_list)
print(predicted_outcomes)
}
