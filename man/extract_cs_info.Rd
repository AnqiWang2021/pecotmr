\usage{
extract_cs_info(con_data, cs_names, top_loci_table)
}
\arguments{
\item{con_data}{List. The method layer data from a finemapping RDS file that is not empty.}

\item{cs_names}{Character vector. Names of the Credible Sets, usually in the format "L_<number>".}

\item{top_loci_table}{Data frame. The $top_loci layer data from the finemapping results.}

\description{
This function extracts and processes information for each Credible Set (CS) 
from finemapping results, typically obtained from a finemapping RDS file.
}
\details{
This function is designed to be used only when there is at least one Credible Set 
in the finemapping results usually for a given study and block. It processes each CS, 
extracting key information such as the top variant, its statistics, and 
correlation information between multiple CS if available.
