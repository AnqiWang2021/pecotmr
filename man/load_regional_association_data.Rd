\arguments{
\item{genotype}{PLINK bed file containing genotype data.}

\item{phenotype}{A vector of phenotype file names.}

\item{covariate}{A vector of covariate file names corresponding to the phenotype file vector.}

\item{region}{A string of chr:start-end for the phenotype region.}

\item{conditions}{A vector of strings representing different conditions or groups.}

\item{maf_cutoff}{Minimum minor allele frequency (MAF) cutoff. Default is 0.}

\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
  \item residual_Y: A list of residualized phenotype values (either a vector or a matrix).
  \item residual_X: A list of residualized genotype matrices for each condition.
  \item residual_Y_scalar: Scaling factor for residualized phenotype values.
  \item residual_X_scalar: Scaling factor for residualized genotype values.
  \item dropped_sample: A list of dropped samples for X, Y, and covariates.
  \item covar: Covariate data.
  \item Y: Original phenotype data.
  \item X_data: Original genotype data.
  \item X: Filtered genotype matrix.
  \item maf: Minor allele frequency (MAF) for each variant.
  \item chrom: Chromosome of the region.
  \item grange: Genomic range of the region (start and end positions).
  \item Y_coordinates: Phenotype coordinates if a region is specified.
