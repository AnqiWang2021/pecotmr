\title{Load genotype data for a specific region using data.table for efficiency}
\usage{
load_genotype_region(genotype, region = NULL, keep_indel = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{genotype}{Path to the genotype data file (without extension).}

\item{region}{The target region in the format "chr:start-end".}

\item{keep_indel}{Whether to keep indel SNPs.}
}
\value{
A vector of SNP IDs in the specified region.

\description{
By default, plink usage dosage of the *major* allele, since "effect allele" A1 is
usually the minor allele and the code "1" refers to the "other allele" A2,
so that "11" is A2/A2 or major/major. We always use effect allele dosage, to
be more consistent with the minor allele based convention ie, plink --recodeA which used minor allele
dosage by default.
