\arguments{
\item{weight_matrices}{a list of weight vectors, one weight vector corresponds
to one gene, name of each list is gene name.}

\item{gwas_sumstat}{a data frame of gwas summary statistics with the columns of:
"id", "A1", "A2", "z".}

\item{ld_dir}{a string, pointing to a directory containing all LD matrix files 
(*.cor.xz) and variant information (*.bim). The .bim file has 5 required columns: 
"chrom", "id", "pos", "alt", "ref" .}

\item{wd}{is a path as working directory that will later create folders for output
files and formatted LDs.}

\item{harmonize_z}{TRUE/FALSE. If TRUE, GWAS and eQTL genotype alleles are 
harmonized}

\item{harmonize_wgt}{TRUE/FALSE. If TRUE, GWAS and eQTL genotype alleles are 
harmonized}

\item{outname}{a string, the output name.}

\item{strand_ambig_action_z}{the action to take to harmonize strand ambiguous variants 
(A/T, G/C) between the z scores and LD reference. "drop" removes the ambiguous variant 
from the z scores. "none" treats the variant as unambiguous, flipping the z score to 
match the LD reference and then taking no additional action. "recover" imputes the sign 
of ambiguous z scores using unambiguous z scores and the LD reference and flips the z 
scores if there is a mismatch between the imputed sign and the observed sign of the z 
score. This option is computationally intensive.}

\item{recover_strand_ambig_wgt}{TRUE/FALSE. If TRUE, a procedure is used to 
recover strand ambiguous variants. If FALSE, these variants are dropped from 
the prediction model.}

\item{outputdir}{a string, the directory to store output}
