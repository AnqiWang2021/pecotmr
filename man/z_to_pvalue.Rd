\title{Convert Z-scores to P-values}
\usage{
z_to_pvalue(z)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{Numeric vector. The z-scores to be converted to p-values.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of p-values corresponding to the input z-scores.
}
\description{
This function calculates p-values from given z-scores using a two-tailed normal distribution.
It supports vector input to process multiple z-scores simultaneously.
}
\details{
The function uses the following formula to calculate p-values:
p-value = 2 * Φ(-|z|)
Where Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.
}
\note{
This function assumes that the input z-scores are from a two-tailed test and
are normally distributed. It calculates two-sided p-values.
For extremely large absolute z-scores, the resulting p-values may be computed as zero
due to floating-point limitations in R. This occurs when the absolute z-score > 37.
}
\examples{
z <- c(2.5, -1.8, 3.2, 0.7)
pvalues <- z_to_pvalue(z)
print(pvalues)
