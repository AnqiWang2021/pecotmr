\title{Load, Validate, and Consolidate TWAS Weights from Multiple RDS Files}
\usage{
load_twas_weights(
  weight_db_files,
  condition,
  region,
  variable_name_obj = NULL,
  twas_weights_table = "twas_weights"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight_db_files}{Vector of file paths for RDS files containing TWAS weights.}

\item{condition}{The specific condition to be checked and consolidated across all files.}

\item{region}{The specific region to be checked and consolidated across all files.}

\item{variable_name_obj}{The name of the variable/object to fetch from each file, if not NULL.}
}
\value{
A consolidated matrix of weights for the specified condition.
}
\description{
This function loads TWAS weight data from multiple RDS files, checks for the presence
of specified region and condition. If variable_name_obj is provided, it aligns and
consolidates weight matrices based on the object's variant names, filling missing data
with zeros. If variable_name_obj is NULL, it checks that all files have the same row
numbers for the condition and consolidates weights accordingly.
}
\examples{
# Example usage (replace with actual file paths, condition, region, and variable_name_obj):
weight_db_files <- c("path/to/file1.rds", "path/to/file2.rds")
condition <- "example_condition"
region <- "example_region"
variable_name_obj <- "example_variable" # or NULL for standard processing
consolidated_weights <- load_twas_weights(weight_db_files, condition, region, variable_name_obj)
print(consolidated_weights)
}
