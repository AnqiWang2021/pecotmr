\describe{
\item{df}{the regions of df are in incresing order and without duplicated rows.}
\item{region_strings}{the regions of input region_strings are in increasing order and without duplicated rows.}
\item{result_list}{A list of length equal to the number of rows in `region_strings`. Each element of this list is itself a list containing:
\describe{
\item{row_start}{The index/row number in df where the intersection starts for each region.}
\item{row_end}{The index/row number in df where the intersection ends.}
\item{file_paths}{A vector of file paths from df corresponding to the intersected regions.}}}
