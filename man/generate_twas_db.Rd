Determine Imputability and Variant Selection

This function load TWAS weights and assesses the imputability of genes across different contexts,
and select top variants for imputable gene-context pair, and output the extracted variant weights
from best performing method model. Imputability of a gene-context pair are determined by having
least one of the twas methods' model being imputable based on cross livadtion metrics. The imputable
model is if the model surpasses the r-square and p-value threashold from cross validation metrics.
If non of the contexts of a gene has at least one method being imputable, then this gene will be
considered as unimputable, and do not return any weight results. For imputable gene-context pair,
we select a subset of variants with high Posterior Inclusion Probabilities (PIPs) from SuSiE
fine-mapping results for the imputable gene-context pair. After selecting variants, we extracts
variant weights from the best performing model among imputable models with highest r-square or
smallest p-value from cross validation metrics. This function is essential for preparing data
for complex trait weighted analysis with sparse weight.}
