\title{Slalom Function for Summary Statistics QC for Fine-Mapping Analysis}
\usage{
slalom(
  zScore,
  LD_mat,
  standard_error = rep(1, length(zScore)),
  abf_prior_variance = 0.04,
  nlog10p_dentist_s_threshold = 4,
  r2_threshold = 0.6,
  lead_variant_choice = "pvalue"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{zScore}{Numeric vector of z-scores corresponding to each variant.}

\item{LD_mat}{Square matrix representing linkage disequilibrium (LD) information
between variants. Must have dimensions matching the length of `zScore`.}

\item{standard_error}{Optional numeric vector of standard errors corresponding
to each z-score. If not provided, a default value of 1 is assumed for all variants.}

\item{abf_prior_variance}{Numeric, the prior effect size variance for ABF calculations.
Default is 0.04.}

\item{nlog10p_dentist_s_threshold}{Numeric, the -log10 DENTIST-S P value threshold
for identifying outlier variants for prediction. Default is 4.0.}

\item{r2_threshold}{Numeric, the r2 threshold for DENTIST-S outlier variants
for prediction. Default is 0.6.}

\item{lead_variant_choice}{Character, method to choose the lead variant, either
"pvalue" or "abf", with default "pvalue".}
}
\value{
A list containing the annotated LD matrix with ABF results, credible sets,
  lead variant, and DENTIST-S statistics; and a summary dataframe with aggregate statistics.
}
\description{
Performs Approximate Bayesian Factor (ABF) analysis, identifies credible sets,
and annotates lead variants based on fine-mapping results. It computes p-values
from z-scores assuming a two-sided standard normal distribution.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `zScore` is your vector of z-scores, `LD_mat` is your LD matrix,
# and optionally `standard_error` is your vector of standard errors:
results <- slalom(zScore, LD_mat, standard_error)
}
