\alias{filter_X_with_Y}
\title{This function performing filters on X variants based on Y subjects for TWAS analysis. This function checks
whether the absence (NA) of certain subjects would lead to monomorphic in some variants in X after removing
of these subjects data from X.}
\usage{
filter_X_with_Y(
  X,
  Y,
  missing_rate_thresh,
  maf_thresh,
  var_thresh = 0,
  maf = NULL,
  X_variance = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{missing_rate_thresh}{Maximum individual missingness cutoff.}

\item{maf_thresh}{Minimum minor allele frequency (MAF) cutoff.}

\item{var_thresh}{Minimum variance cutoff for a variant. Default is 0.}

\item{X_variance}{A vector of variance for X variants.}
