\title{Perform Quality Control based on SuSiE RSS}
\usage{
susie_rss_qc(sumstats, LD_mat, n = NULL, var_y = NULL, L = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{sumstats}{A data frame containing summary statistics with 'variant_id', 'z', and 'pos' columns.}

\item{LD_mat}{Numeric matrix representing the LD (linkage disequilibrium) matrix.}

\item{L}{Number of causal configurations to consider in the analysis.}
}
\value{
A list containing the quality-controlled summary statistics and updated LD matrix.
  - sumstats_qc: A data frame containing the quality-controlled summary statistics.
  - LD_mat_qc: The updated LD matrix excluding outlier variants.
}
\description{
This function performs quality control on summary statistics using SuSiE RSS.
It identifies and removes outliers based on z-score and LD matrix discrepancy correction.
}
\details{
This function performs quality control on summary statistics using SuSiE RSS.
  It first extracts the z-scores from the `sumstats` data frame and performs SuSiE RSS analysis
  with discrepancy correction using the `susie_rss` function.

  Next, it identifies outlier variants based on the results of the SuSiE RSS analysis.
  It removes the outlier variants from the summary statistics and updates the LD matrix accordingly.

  Finally, it returns a list containing the quality-controlled summary statistics and the updated LD matrix.
